"CNN on images" is a Jupyter notebook that trains a CNN on CT scans of lungs to predict whether a previously unseen scan is normal, or has a benign or malignant tumour.
"Classification using ML" is a jupyter notebook that trains different ML algorithms on categorical data like age, smoking, fatigue and other factors and uses them to predict the likelihood of a person having lung cancer.
